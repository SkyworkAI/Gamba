## Gamba

This is the official implementation of *Gamba: Marry Gaussian Splatting with Mamba for single view 3D reconstruction*.

### [Project Page](https://florinshen.github.io/gamba-project) | [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18795) | [Weights](https://huggingface.co/florinshen/Gamba)

### Why Gamba
ðŸ”¥ Reconstruct 3D object from a single image input within 50 milliseconds. 


ðŸ”¥ First end-to-end trainable single-view reconstruction model with 3DGS.

### Install

```bash
# xformers is required! please refer to https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers for details.
# for example, we use torch 2.1.0 + cuda 11.8
pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install causal-conv1d==1.2.0 mamba-ssm
git clone --recursive git@github.com:SkyworkAI/Gamba.git
# a modified gaussian splatting (+ depth, alpha rendering)
pip install ./submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization
# radial polygon mask, only in training,
pip install ./submodules/rad-polygon-mask

# for mesh extraction
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast

# other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pretrained Weights

Our pretrained weight can be downloaded from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/florinshen/Gamba). A lager Model is comming on the way!

For example, to download the bf16 model for inference:
```bash
mkdir checkpoint && cd checkpoint
wget https://huggingface.co/florinshen/Gamba/resolve/main/gamba_ep399.pth
cd ..
```

### Inference

Inference takes about 1.5GB GPU memory within 50 milliseconds.

```bash
bash scripts/test.sh
```

For more options, please check [options](./core/options.py).

### Training

We will update training tutorials soon.
